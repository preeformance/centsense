## Optimizations

Updated budget page to help users see their balance. Next steps are to add the graphs to show a pi chart that breaks down the categories of the user's spending.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how the front end works together for styling and event listeners. This was a group endeavor so I also had to practice clear communication to help everyone be on the same page.
